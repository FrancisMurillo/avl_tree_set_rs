* Understanding Rust Through AVL Trees

This Rust library is for my [[http://francismurillo.github.io/2019-07-31-Understanding-Rust-Through-AVL-Trees/][blog post]]. For any correction or suggestion
on the post, do file an issue.

If you want an AVL tree set for production instead, consider the mature
[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/btree_set/struct.BTreeSet.html#method.iter][BTreeSet]] which performs better.
